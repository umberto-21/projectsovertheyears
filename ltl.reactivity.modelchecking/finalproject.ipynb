With the last two nested loops the function tries to find a cycling execution that satisfy the negated LTL formula. The important bit is that in the pre-image calculation the region is intersected with the negation of the `spec_g` formula. In this way the algorithm is sure that the states in the pre-image region always satisfy the negated `spec_g`. So, if a cycling execution is found, we can be sure that: not only `spec_f` is always eventually satisfied but also that not `spec_g` is eventually always satisfied.\n",
